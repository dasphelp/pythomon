# Daniel Phelps
# Assignment 10.1: Your Own Class
# Create a class to model Pokemon.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
# Pokemon are intellectual property owned by The Pokemon Company.
# I used the Pokemon Chimchar's base statistics from the website 'Pokemon Database' https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/chimchar as a model for the base stats of my Pokemon. 
# I borrowed the abstraction of mechanisms that are present in the Pokemon video games, but I did not borrow any of the actual programming logic behind them in this assignment.
# For example, I know that in the games, Fire moves do special damage against Grass pokemon, but I came up with how to impement this and other mechanisms like this into code on my own.

# Import random for rng in stat and damage calculators.
import random

# Import time to create natural pauses in terminal.
import time

# This class models Pokemon with their states and behaviors as featured in the Pokemon videogames.
