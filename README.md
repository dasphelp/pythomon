# Pythomon
by Daniel Phelps (2021)

The program is a shell that initiates 'Pythomon'. It is based off of the Pokemon video games, specifically their battling, stats, and experience level mechanisms. You get to choose a Pokemon, give it a nickname, and battle with it as it grows in experience!

## Instructions:
- Since the program is a shell, all instructions on how to manuever through the program are built into its terminal interface.
- To start the program, open up a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the program, and run 'python' or 'python3' or 'python2', followed by 'pythomon.py'.

## Classes:
### 'Pokemon'
- The 'Pokemon' class models Pokemon, fictional creatures originally created by Satoshi Tajiri. 
- These Pokemon have states and behaviors just like creatures in the real world, and many of the methods and attributes of the Pokemon class model their states and behaviors.
- The rest of the methods and variables aid the system to help interact with the Pokemon's data.
- Some of these methods include: battling, leveling up, and checking stats.
- Some of the attributes include: species, attack, defense, and experience.
#### Class Attributes:
- 'move_dictionary'
	- 'move_dictionary' stores all of the moves available to Pokemon in battle as a dictionary.
  	- The types of the moves are the keys of the dictionary, and the moves belonging to each type are the values of each key in lists.
#### Data Attibutes (Private):
- '__pokemon_dictionary'
	- stores all the species of Pokemon available as a dictionary.
	- The types of Pokemon are the keys of the dictionary, and the Pokemon belonging to each type are the values of each key in lists.
- '__type'
	- stores the type of a Pokemon as a string.
- '__species'
	- stores the species of a Pokemon as a string.
- '__level'
	- stores the level of a Pokemon as an int. The level of a Pokemon is an indicator of its abilities.
- '__hp'
	- stores the maximum hitpoints of a Pokemon as an int.
- '__temp_hp'
	- stores the hitpoints of a Pokemon during battle as an int. 
- '__attack'
	- stores the attack power of a Pokemon as an int.
- '__defense'
	- stores the defense power of a Pokemon as an int.
- '__nickname'
	- stores the nickname given to a Pokemon as a string.
- '__experience'
	- stores the experience points of a Pokemon as an int.
	- A pokemon gains experience points after winning a battle, and once these points reach a certain number, the Pokemon levels up.
- '__experience_cap'
	- stores the number that a Pokemon's experience must reach in order to level up as an int.
#### Methods (NOTE: ALL CLASS METHODS TAKE IN SELF [OBJECT] AS FIRST ARGUMENT):
- 'get_nickname'
	- returns 'self.__nickname'.
- 'set_nickname'
	- renames the user's Pokemon.
	- takes string argument 'nickname' (nickname to give to the Pokemon) as input.
- 'get_hp'
	- returns 'self.__hp'.
- 'set_hp'
	- takes int argument 'hp' as input.
	- sets the Pokemon's HP stat to 'hp', a given number.
- 'get_pokemon_dictionary'
	- returns 'self.__pokemon_dictionary'.
- 'get_species'
	- returns 'self.__species'.
- 'get_type'
	- returns 'self.__type'.
- 'get_attack'
	- returns 'self.__attack'.
- 'get_defense'
	- returns 'self.__defense'.
- 'get_stats'
	- creates a string compiling all of the Pokemon's stats and assigns it to the variable 'stats'.
 	- 'stats' is also returned.
- '__check_experience'
	- checks if 'self.__experience' has reached 'self.__experience_cap'.
 		- If it has, the Pokemon levels up, its experience is reset, and the method returns boolean value 'True'.
		- Otherwise, the method returns boolean value 'False'.
- '__level_up'
	- raises the Pokemon's level by 1 and increases all of its stats.
- 'wild_encounter'
	- initiates a battle between the user's Pokemon and a random Pokemon.
	- also prints a win/lose statement and updates the user's Pokemon's experience after a win.
- '__my_attack'
	- takes the string argument 'species' (the species of the user's Pokemon) as input.
	- runs the user's turn in battle, requesting an attack in shell and dealing out damage.
- '__foe_attack'
	- takes the string argument 'species' (the species of the foe Pokemon) as input.
	- runs the foe's turn in battle, picking a random move for it and dealing out damage.
- '__get_movebox'
	- takes the string arguments 'move1' and 'move2' (moves available to the user's Pokemon) as inputs.
	- creates a formatted box containing the available moves as a string, assigning the string to the variable 'movebox'.
	- 'movebox' is also returned.
- '__compare_types'
	- takes the string arguments 'type1' (the type of the attacking Pokemon) and 'type2' (the type of the defending Pokemon) as inputs.
	- compares the types of the Pokemon to figure out if there is a type advantange between the two.
		- Grass Pokemon do more damage to Water Pokemon, Water to Fire, and Fire to Grass.
		- Grass Pokemon do less damage to Grass and Fire Pokemon, Water to Water and Grass, and Fire to Fire and Water.
	 	- Advantage/disadvantages are represented by a number that will be factored into damage calculations during a battle (type advantages mean higher numbers).
	      	- This number is returned as 'special' and a message that states the advantage status is returned as 'message'.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
- Pokemon are intellectual property owned by The Pokemon Company.
- I used the Pokemon Chimchar's base statistics from the website 'Pokemon Database' https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/chimchar as a model for the base stats of my Pokemon. 
- I borrowed the abstraction of mechanisms that are present in the Pokemon video games, but I did not borrow any of the actual programming logic behind them for this project.
- For example, I know that in the games, Fire moves do extra damage against Grass pokemon, but I came up with how to impement this and other mechanisms like this into code on my own.
